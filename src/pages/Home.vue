          One of the causes of the gender wage gap is discrimination. Society
          must confront cultural biases that continue to harm women by devaluing
          their work and confining them to specific gender roles.

          Compared to men, women are less likely to work full-time, more likely
          to be employed in lower-paid occupations, and less likely to progress
          in their careers. As a result gender pay gaps persist and women are
          more likely to end their lives in poverty.

              So-called women’s jobs, which are jobs that have historically had majority-female workforces, such as home health aides and child care workers, tend to offer lower pay and fewer benefits than so-called men’s jobs, which are jobs that have had predominantly male workforces, including jobs in trades such as building and construction.

              Because women tend to work fewer hours to accommodate caregiving and other unpaid obligations, they are also more likely to work part time, which means lower hourly wages and fewer benefits compared with full-time workers.

              Gender-based pay discrimination has been illegal since 1963 but is still a frequent, widespread practice—particularly for women of color. It can thrive especially in workplaces that discourage open discussion of wages and where employees fear retaliation.
